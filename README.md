# Revri: Turn Product Vision Into Development Reality

## The Problem
Product managers waste countless hours translating high-level product visions into actionable development tickets. The gap between "what we want to build" and "what developers can actually work on" creates bottlenecks, miscommunication, and delayed launches. Traditional project management tools force PMs to jump between ideation, specification writing, and ticket creationâ€”fragmenting the planning process and losing critical context along the way.

## The Solution
Revri is the first planning platform designed specifically for the product manager's workflow during the critical pre-development phase. Transform your product ideas into comprehensive, developer-ready backlogs with intelligent guidance, automated ticket generation, and seamless handoff to your development team.

## Key Features

**Smart Backlog Builder**
- AI-powered feature breakdown that suggests user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical considerations
- Template library for common product patterns (onboarding flows, payment systems, admin panels)
- Automatic estimation and priority scoring based on product goals

**Collaboration Hub**
- Real-time collaboration with stakeholders during the planning phase
- Comment threads and approval workflows for each feature specification
- Integration with design tools to link mockups directly to development tickets

**Developer Handoff**
- One-click export to Jira, Linear, Asana, or any ticketing system
- Maintains all context, discussions, and decisions in the transition
- Automated technical debt identification and dependency mapping

## The Value Proposition

**For Product Managers:**
- Reduce planning time by 60% with intelligent feature breakdown
- Eliminate the context-switching between ideation and execution
- Ensure nothing falls through the cracks during handoff

**For Development Teams:**
- Receive clear, comprehensive tickets with full context
- Reduce back-and-forth questions by 70%
- Start coding faster with better-defined requirements

**For Organizations:**
- Accelerate time-to-market with streamlined planning processes
- Improve cross-team alignment and reduce miscommunication
- Scale product development without scaling planning overhead

## Why Now?
Product teams are under more pressure than ever to deliver quickly while maintaining quality. The tools that worked for small teams don't scale, and enterprise solutions are too heavy for the dynamic planning phase. Revri bridges the gap between lightweight ideation tools and heavy project management platforms.

## Target Market
- Series A-C startups scaling their product teams (50-500 employees)
- Mid-market companies building digital products (SaaS, e-commerce, fintech)
- Enterprise teams launching new product lines or digital transformation initiatives

## Business Model
TBD
